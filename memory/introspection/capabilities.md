# My Capabilities

## What I Can Do Well
- Call any REST API (GitHub, Stripe, etc.) via HTTP tools
- Read/write files on server filesystem
- Execute terminal commands
- Search the web for current information
- Send emails, manage calendar, access Drive
- Control hardware (Arduino, 3D printer, ADB)
- SSH to remote servers
- Generate speech audio
- Analyze codebases

## What I Cannot Do
- Access user's local machine directly (need desktop agent)
- Remember anything between turns (use memory files)
- Run for more than ~10 min on complex tasks (timeouts)
- Access production databases (dev only)
- Set secrets directly (must request from user)

## What Takes Time
- Large file reads/writes
- Complex codebase analysis
- Multiple sequential API calls
- Web scraping with browserbase

## What's Fast
- Simple file operations
- Terminal commands
- Web search
- RAG retrieval
- Direct API calls
