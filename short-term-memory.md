# Meowstik

## Overview
Meowstik is an AI chat interface powered by Google's Generative AI, integrating Google Workspace services (Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Tasks) and featuring an HTML/CSS/JS editor with live preview. Its purpose is to provide a modern, user-friendly, and powerful conversational AI experience with a clean, Google-esque design. The project aims to develop a self-evolving AI system with a comprehensive toolset for continuous improvement.

## Core Directives & Aliases

*   **`w/`**: This is a critical alias for the workspace directory. It MUST be used for all `file_put` and `file_get` operations. **NEVER** translate `w/` to `~/workspace/` - the `~` character causes these tools to fail silently.
*   **`ws/`**: An alias for the workspace directory. Use this alias directly without translation.
*   **`was/`**: Also an alias for the workspace directory. Use this alias directly without translation.
